/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for iLearn Platform
 *
 * @core_philosophy This ruleset enforces a role-based access control model with an emphasis on ownership and organization-scoped data access.
 * Data access is restricted based on user roles (admin, teacher, student) and their association with specific organizations.
 * The rules are designed to prevent unauthorized data access and manipulation while enabling core application features.
 *
 * @data_structure
 * - /organizations/{orgId}: Stores organization details.
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user details, including role and organization ID.
 * - /classes/{classId}: Stores class details.
 * - /playlists/{playlistId}: Stores playlist details.
 * - /videos/{videoId}: Stores video details.
 * - /videos/{videoId}/segments/{segmentId}: Stores video segment details.
 * - /videos/{videoId}/segments/{segmentId}/questions/{questionId}: Stores question details for video segments.
 * - /assignments/{assignmentId}: Stores assignment details.
 * - /progress/{progressId}: Stores student progress for assignments.
 * - /attempts/{attemptId}: Stores student attempts to answer questions.
 * - /subscription_plans/{subscriptionPlanId}: Stores subscription plans (admin only).
 * - /teacher_subscriptions/{teacherSubscriptionId}: Stores teacher subscriptions.
 * - /settings/theme: Stores global settings such as theme.
 *
 * @key_security_decisions
 * - Access to organization-related data is generally restricted to users within that organization.
 * - Admin users have elevated privileges, such as managing subscription plans.
 * - Data consistency is enforced by validating relationships between documents (e.g., orgId on resources).
 * - Data is not listable unless explicitly allowed and secured.
 * - Public reads are disallowed, except for `/settings/theme`.
 *
 * @denormalization_for_authorization
 * - The `orgId` is denormalized across most collections to enable organization-scoped authorization without extra reads.
 * - The `User` document contains the `role` field for role-based access control.
 * - The `TeacherSubscription` document contains the `userId` field to simplify access control.
 *
 * @structural_segregation Not applicable in this data model.
