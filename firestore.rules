/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for iLearn application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user-specific data and an organization-based access control model for shared resources.
 * It prioritizes security by default, requiring explicit rules for all read and write operations.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /organizations/{orgId}: Stores organization details. Accessible with orgId.
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user details. Owner-only access.
 * - /classes/{classId}: Stores class details.
 * - /playlists/{playlistId}: Stores playlist details.
 * - /videos/{videoId}: Stores video details.
 * - /videos/{videoId}/segments/{segmentId}: Stores video segments.
 * - /videos/{videoId}/segments/{segmentId}/questions/{questionId}: Stores questions for segments.
 * - /assignments/{assignmentId}: Stores assignment details.
 * - /progress/{progressId}: Stores student progress.
 * - /attempts/{attemptId}: Stores student attempts.
 * - /subscription_plans/{subscriptionPlanId}: Stores subscription plans. Accessible by admins.
 * - /teacher_subscriptions/{teacherSubscriptionId}: Stores teacher subscriptions.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read/write their own user document.
 * - Data within an organization is generally accessible to users within that organization, verified by the `orgId` field.
 * - List operations on the root `/users` collection are denied to prevent user enumeration.
 * - All writes require authentication.
 * - Data validation is limited to authorization-critical fields in the prototyping phase.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Most documents include the `orgId` to allow for efficient organization-based access control.
 * - The `TeacherSubscription` document includes the `userId` for direct rule-based access control.
