/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for iLearn Platform
 *
 * @core_philosophy This ruleset enforces a role-based access control model with user-ownership principles.
 *  - Users can only read/write their own data.
 *  - Admins can manage subscription plans and teacher subscriptions.
 *  - Data is scoped by organization to prevent cross-organizational access.
 *  - Public read access is generally disallowed except where explicitly intended.
 *
 * @data_structure
 *  - /organizations/{orgId}: Stores organization details.
 *  - /users/{userId}: Stores user details; the role is stored here for each user.
 *  - /classes/{classId}: Stores class details.
 *  - /playlists/{playlistId}: Stores playlist details.
 *  - /videos/{videoId}: Stores video details.
 *  - /videos/{videoId}/segments/{segmentId}: Stores segment details for a video.
 *  - /videos/{videoId}/segments/{segmentId}/questions/{questionId}: Stores question details for a video segment.
 *  - /assignments/{assignmentId}: Stores assignment details.
 *  - /progress/{progressId}: Stores student progress for an assignment.
 *  - /attempts/{attemptId}: Stores student attempts to answer questions.
 *  - /subscription_plans/{subscriptionPlanId}: Stores subscription plan details.
 *  - /teacher_subscriptions/{teacherSubscriptionId}: Stores teacher subscriptions to specific plans.
 *
 * @key_security_decisions
 *  - User listing is generally disallowed.
 *  - Strict ownership checks are enforced for user-specific data.
 *  - Write operations are never fully open (i.e., `if true;` is not used for writes).
 *  - Roles are stored in the `users` collection for easy access.
 *  - Data is denormalized (e.g., orgId on most documents) for efficient security rules.
 *  - The settings collection, as indicated by the error log, is readable by all users.
 *
 * @denormalization_for_authorization
 *  - `orgId` is present on most documents to avoid needing to traverse the hierarchy for authorization.
 *  - The `User` document includes the `role` to avoid additional reads for role-based checks.
 *  - `TeacherSubscription` documents include `userId` to enable direct access control.
 *
 * @structural_segregation
 *  - Private data (e.g., user profiles) is stored under `/users/{userId}` with strict ownership checks.
