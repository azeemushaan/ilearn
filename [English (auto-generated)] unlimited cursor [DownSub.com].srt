00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,439
In this video, I'm going to show you how

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:03,600
to use unlimited vibe code with cursor

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,200
and claude code. So, you're going to be

4
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,879
able to use the unlimited for free with

5
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:08,559
the latest models. By the end of this

6
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:10,240
video, I'm going to show you how to set

7
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,679
everything up with no technical

8
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:13,599
knowledge and no credit card. I'm also

9
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:14,639
going to show you how to create a

10
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,240
website from start to finish. I've

11
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:17,760

12
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,199
going to show you the best way how.

13
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:20,160

17
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:26,800
I'm going to try to make this the most

18
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,880
useful video on YouTube for vibe coding.

19
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,160
You don't need a credit card. You don't

20
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,000
need technical experience and the best

21
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,239
way I know how from just trial and error

22
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,399
and just from expertise of just learning

23
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,160
along the way. I know you guys enjoy my

24
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,000
previous videos about Vibe Coding. So, I

25
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,160
want to create a follow-up video for you

26
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,719
guys to continue on in the Vibe Code

27
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,719
journey. Any links that I mentioned in

28
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,480
here, put all of the links in the

29
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,160
description down below for your

30
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,600
reference as well. First off, go to

31
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,280
google.com, type in ravoev. So, ro ov e

32
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,719
v. Once you're here, you're going to

33
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:57,920
click on the first link. You don't need

34
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,440
a credit card. Everything in this video

35
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,120
is completely for free. So you're here.

36
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,039
You're going to click on try it now. It

37
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:04,879
says work email, but you can enter any

38
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,880
email you want. For me, I like to use

39
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,640
Gmail. So for example, this is one

40
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,400
email, right? After the trial up and you

41
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,760
want to do another one, you just do a

42
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,360
dot. So this is a new email. And then

43
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,200
you want to do another email dot. So

44
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,280
this is just kind of like a email people

45
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,439
do to get unlimited Gmails. So we're

46
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,119
going to sign up for a account right

47
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:22,799
now. You can see here the green. And

48
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,400
then I'm going to click sign up. You'll

49
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,479
be presented with this screen. Next up,

50
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:27,840
you're going to go to your email and

51
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,280
then get the code that they just sent

52
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,560
you. So, I'm going to go to my email and

53
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,000
get the code. So, when you're in your

54
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
email, you'll see a code like this. And

55
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,280
you can see here that I have the code.

56
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,640
All you got to do is take that code,

57
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,479
right click, copy, go back to that

58
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,240
window, paste that code in, and then

59
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,079
after that, you'll see it's email

60
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,920
address verified. And then for here, you

61
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,600
just enter any name. And then for the

62
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,119
password, you enter literally any

63
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:48,720
password. Press continue. Next up,

64
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,240
you're presented with the screen. For

65
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,759
your site name, you have to enter

66
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,439
anything. Just pick something random

67
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:54,799
that's available. And then when you see

68
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,799
it is green on and then I put agree and

69
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,240
start. Now you'll get presented with

70
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,840
this window. Once it is successfully

71
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,280
loaded, you'll get presented with this

72
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,040
like tutorial thing. Just click X. You

73
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,240
don't really need it. And then when

74
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,759
you're here, you're going to click on

75
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,239
Bravo Dev CLI. Next up, we're going to

76
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,319
install Bravo Dev CLI. If you have a

77
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:12,080
Mac, click on Mac. If you have a

78
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,000
Windows, click on Windows. If you have a

79
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,840
Linux, click on Linux. Right now, we're

80
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,360
using a Mac, so we're going to click on

81
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,040
Mac. You can see here that it opened a

82
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,319
new window. Next up, you're going to

83
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,000
open up your terminal. Take this first

84
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,239
link. Copy. Go to your terminal, paste

85
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,319
it in, press enter, and you can see here

86
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,160
that it's successfully installed. I

87
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,680
already had it installed, so it's just

88
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,280
turned to updating, but for you, it will

89
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,879
show something similar. Next up, you're

90
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,080
going to click the second link right

91
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,640
here, brew install ACL. Go back to that

92
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,040
same terminal. Ctrl +V, copy and paste

93
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,120
it in, press enter. From there, there

94
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,599
you go. Once you see it pop back to this

95
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,200
empty spot, then you'll know it's

96
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,200
successfully installed. If you make sure

97
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,360
you check for this third one, this is a

98
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,040
command that check the version you have.

99
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,239
copy ACL live space- version. Go back to

100
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,000
your terminal, press enter, and it

101
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,599
should say some type of version, but for

102
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,200
you, it'll be whatever version in the

103
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,480
current time you're watching it in. So,

104
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,560
it's continually updating. Now, we can

105
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,560
go back to our web browser. We can close

106
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,920
this window. Next, we're going to

107
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,159
generate an API token. Click that link.

108
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,360
You can see here that another

109
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,200
verification code has been sent to your

110
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,879
email. So, go back to the email that you

111
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,480
originally used earlier. You take that

112
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,720
code from the email, you go back to that

113
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,720
page, and then you press Ctrl +V and

114
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,480
paste it in. Next, you'll be presented

115
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,720
with this window. Click on create API

116
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,560
token. For the name, name it anything

117
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,640
you want. For the date, choose any date

118
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,640
you want. Typically, I see it last about

119
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,400
you'll be able to vibe code for about 6

120
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,760
hours and then you'll just create a new

121
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,680
one and you then you'll get another 20

122
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,519
million credits again. And you just keep

123
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:36,640
doing it and it's pretty much just

124
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,560
unlimited vibe coding. So, we pick a

125
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,920
date in the future. We picked any name

126
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,519
we want and we press create and then you

127
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:42,959
can see here that successfully

128
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,400
generated. In the terminal, you're going

129
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,760
to type in a space ravo dev space off

130
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,680
space logout. and you'll see log out

131
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,200
successfully. This is the step that you

132
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,440
would do if you've pre previously used

133
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,799
of the trial again and you want to use

134
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,080
another new trial. All you have to do is

135
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,000
log out. So you can see I'm logged out

136
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,760
successfully of my old trial. Next,

137
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,840
you're going to type in a CLI base robot

138
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,560
dev off base log in. You'll see the

139
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,239
email. This is the email that you used

140
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:07,680
previously. So I'm going to input my

141
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,599
email. Then when here press enter and

142
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,360
then it's going to say enter your API

143
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,040
token. So this is just go back to your

144
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,400
window. This is just the one that we

145
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,079
created. Click on copy and you can see

146
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,079
API token copy to clipboard. Go back to

147
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,919
your terminal, paste it in, press enter,

148
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:21,919
and once you see the authentification

149
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:24,080
successful, this means that everything

150
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,680
is completely set up for you to vibe

151
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,440
code unlimitedly. If you redo this

152
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,120
process over again, you'll be you'll

153
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,800
have a brand new account, fresh tokens.

154
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,560
Again, this was the part of how to set

155
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,560
up Ravo Dev and how to get all the

156
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,320
features of Claude code and cursor

157
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,840
completely for free. Next up, I'm going

158
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,360
to show you how to create a website from

159
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,199
start to finish. So, we go back here. If

160
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,639
you want to save this as well, this is

161
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,400
just pretty much how to log in. And this

162
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,000
is just pretty much how to run it. So

163
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,600
you pretty much once you open up in any

164
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,199
folder you you type in this command

165
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,880
right here and then you press enter. And

166
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,560
when you type it in and press enter it

167
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,479
opens up the CLI which I will show you

168
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,639
next. Let's create the website. So go

169
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,759
open up your terminal type in cd and

170
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,680
then type in the brand new directory

171
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,080
that you want to show. So to create a

172
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,520
brand new directory what I'm going to do

173
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,520
is this. I opened up a brand new folder.

174
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,680
Right click new folder. We'll name this

175
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,120
directory tech Kevin website. And you

176
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,600
can see that in the in the terminal I

177
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,440
typed in cd. I'm literally just going to

178
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,720
drag and drop. You can do this on

179
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,400
Windows as well. Next on your terminal,

180
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,840
you'll see that we're currently in the

181
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,680
directory of tech cabin website. This

182
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,039
literally is just an empty folder right

183
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:27,360
now, right? We're going to type in ACL

184
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,160
ACL space ravo dev space run. When this

185
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,759
pops up, just click allow. And then you

186
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,759
can see that once we're in here, we can

187
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,759
see that everything successfully set up

188
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,600
and we have access to all of the latest

189
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,000
models. The slash icon and then you'll

190
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,199
be presented with a bunch of different

191
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,880
options. Click the dash and then you're

192
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,039
going to go down to yolo. You're going

193
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:47,759
to go down to yolo. Press enter. And

194
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,759
once you can see yolo is engaged. What

195
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,080
this does is it pretty much skips on all

196
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,680
the confirmations and just vibe codes

197
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,960
all the way to the end. If you click

198
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,720
here, you can also clear the window. And

199
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,160
then you can also go down. There's

200
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,440
different options as well. You can

201
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,919
clear, you can copy, you can go to

202
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,360
different directories, manage it, you

203
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,160
can go feedback, help, IDE, MCP servers

204
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,759
if you have that. You can also do

205
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,000
memory. And if you go down to models,

206
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,440
you can change the models. So, they

207
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,120
currently have GPT 5, which is the

208
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,600
latest GBT. They have the latest Sonnet

209
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,759
as well, 4.5. Okay, since we're in the

210
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,039
directory, I'll show you guys how to

211
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,120
create a brand new website now. And so,

212
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,479
since we have everything set up right

213
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,880
now, the prompt I'm going to type in is

214
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:30,479
create me a React website. I added a

215
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,240
image folder with a template screenshot.

216
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,520
It's not going to come be perfect, but

217
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,120
it's going to be something pretty nice.

218
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,600
I want you to create me a website

219
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,319
exactly similar to the UX of that. You

220
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:47,840
press enter. See that right now it's

221
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,680
successfully vibe coding. I I'm using

222
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,639
GPT5. And then we're going to create the

223
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,240
React website right now. And make sure

224
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,840
you type in that prompt exactly like

225
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,840
kind of how it is. Say create me a React

226
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,919
website. So because if you say create a

227
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,319
website just in general it might just do

228
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,120
basic different text stack you know but

229
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,880
using the react I'm telling it to create

230
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,039
me a react website and we just wait for

231
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,880
it to do its magic and you can pretty

232
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,639
much just do this unlimitedly you can

233
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,400
create any sort of website you can

234
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,400
create any sort of app any sort of

235
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,880
software it can do you can ask it

236
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,560
questions you can use it kind of like

237
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,360
cloud pro or chat tbt pro and just ask

238
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,599
it questions okay guys so it looks like

239
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,520
it finished when it's done you'll see

240
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,120
something like this towards the end. It

241
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,120
says your React website. So, you can see

242
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,479
here that we just created a sample

243
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,240
website. And then we're just going to go

244
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,479
here. We're going to copy and paste that

245
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,759
localhost that colon 3000. And it's it's

246
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,039
pretty quick, right? And we're going to

247
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:42,639
go back to our web browser. We're going

248
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,080
to paste it in localhost colon thing um

249
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,160
3000. Wow. And this is that we just

250
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,680
created right now. So, this is just

251
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,680
literally one prompt, a single prompt

252
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,080
that we that we pasted it in and we

253
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,479
literally created this entire just one

254
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,000
page right now. But we can create more

255
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,240
pages. This is just one prompt as well.

256
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,400
So I'm actually pretty amazed by this.

257
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,000
And you can see here literally from one

258
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,680
prompt this was the result. You can see

259
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,280
here this is a local this is not a live

260
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,120
website. We but we can host it live

261
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,199
later. That's it for the video. I hope

262
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,720
